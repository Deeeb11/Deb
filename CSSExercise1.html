        Also known as ‘the Korean mango’, there are two main types. The astringent persimmon reflects the mango shape, but the non-astringent persimmon is actually shaped more like a tomato.
        <strong> Their outside skin ranges from pale yellow, to red-orange, with yellow-orange flesh inside with a soft jelly-like texture. </strong>
        Korean fruit name: 
        <em>Persimmon (gam)</em> And they taste sweet; many people compare the flavour to honey. 
        Dried persimmon is useful for drinks such as Korean cinnamon punch, known as ‘sujeonggwa’, as well as for teas..
