        <p><q>Going back to the corner where I first saw you
            Gonna camp in my sleeping bag, I'm not gonna move
            Got some words on cardboard, got your picture in my hand
            Saying, "If you see this girl can you tell her where I am?"
            Some try to hand me money, they don't understand
            I'm not broke, I'm just a broken-hearted man
            I know it makes no sense but what else can I do?
            And how can I move on when I'm still in love with you?
            'Cause if one day you wake up and find that you're missing me
            And your heart starts to wonder where on this earth I could be
            Thinking maybe you'll come back here to the place that we'd meet
            And you'll see me waiting for you on the corner of the street
            So I'm not moving, I'm not moving
            Policeman says, "Son, you can't stay here"
            I said, "There's someone I'm waiting for if it's a day, a month, a year
            Gotta stand my ground even if it rains or snows
            If she changes her mind this is the first place she will go"
            'Cause if one day you wake up and find that you're missing me
            And your heart starts to wonder where on this earth I could be
            Thinking maybe you'll come back here to the place that we'd meet
            And you'll see me waiting for you on the corner of the street
            So I'm not moving, I'm not moving
            I'm not moving, I'm not moving
            People talk about the guy that's waiting on a girl, oh...
            There are no holes in his shoes but a big hole in his world, hmm
            And maybe I'll get famous as the man who can't be moved
            And maybe you won't mean to but you'll see me on the news
            And you'll come running to the corner
            'Cause you'll know it's just for you
            I'm the man who can't be moved
            I'm the man who can't be moved
            'Cause if one day you wake up and find that you're missing me
            And your heart starts to wonder where on this earth I could be
            Thinking maybe you'll come back here to the place that we'd meet
            And you'll see me waiting for you on the corner of the street
            'Cause if one day you wake up and find that you're missing me
            And your heart starts to wonder where on this earth I could be
            Thinking maybe you'll come back here to the place that we'd meet
            And you'll see me waiting for you on the corner of the street
            Going back to the corner where I first saw you
            Gonna camp in my sleeping bag, I'm not gonna move</q></p>
